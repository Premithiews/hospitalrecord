# HospitalRecords Smart Contract

## Vision

The vision of the `HospitalRecords` smart contract is to create a decentralized and transparent system for managing hospital records. The goal is to ensure that patient and doctor records are securely stored on the blockchain, providing a tamper-proof, transparent, and accessible platform that improves the efficiency and reliability of healthcare management.

## Flowchart

The flowchart below describes the flow of operations within the `HospitalRecords` contract:
